## Ascii-art-web Stylize

### Description
Stylize is a optional task for Ascii-Art-Web. 

Ascii-art-web itself is a web server which enables the user to change their ascii input into ascii art. It is possible to choose from three different fonts: standard, shadow or thinkertoy. <br/>
The intructions are same as in the main project, the big difference is that this time the website must be more appealing, interactive, intuitive and user friendly.  <br/>
The output will look something like this:
```
   _____  _           _  _           
  / ____|| |         | |(_)          
 | (___  | |_  _   _ | | _  ____ ___ 
  \___ \ | __|| | | || || ||_  // _ \
  ____) || |_ | |_| || || | / /|  __/
 |_____/  \__| \__, ||_||_|/___|\___|
                __/ |                
               |___/                 
```

### How to run
To run the program, type the following command to the terminal: `go run server.go` <br/>
This will start a server at port 8080. <br/>
Open http://localhost:8080/ from your browser. <br/>
Select the font and type in the input.
